# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm Icoza, but I'd prefer being called Zero. I like messing around with code and programs I should not mess around with and actually sometimes *making stuff* (who could've guessed!)

#### I respond most on Discord where I'm called wasthatzero so if you need to reach out then send a friend request there :)

So that's kinda it. As I said, if you want to get in touch then just send me a friend request on Discord, I don't bite ðŸ˜‰

I also regret installing Windows 11 on my laptop, if that helps you know me better.

See ya later!
